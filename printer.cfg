# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2020 Creality Ender 3
# V2. To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the
# STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader" and with "Use USB for
# communication" disabled.

# If you prefer a direct serial connection, in "make menuconfig"
# select "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and select the
# USART3 serial port, which is broken out on the 10 pin IDC cable used
# for the LCD module as follows:
# 3: Tx, 4: Rx, 9: GND, 10: VCC

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
